SMTP GUIDE :


----- THE GUIDE DESCRIBE THE EXECUTION PROCEDURE OF PHPMAILER FRAMEWORK, IN CONTRAST TO SMTP -----


The execution starts with creating a new object of PhpMailer object & hence we are calling the __construct() function of PHPMailer{} class.
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);
The Class IS :         PHPMailer
functionc Is :          __construct
In which you can set the debug output type.
inside the constructor we are checking for the Php SAPI it is using,
if the SApI is used as 'cli' or 'cli server' then debug output is 'echo' only otherwise 'html', or other format are also possible.


then from the mymail.php [the source file from which - the file is php miler is initialised is] i am initialising the protocol as "SMTP" 
by calling isSMTP() method of PHPMailer{} class
The File Is :           /opt/lampp/htdocs/mail/PHPMailer.php
The Class IS :          PHPMailer
functionc Is :          isSMTP
Method name Is :        PHPMailer::isSMTP
Here i am setting the the protocol as SMTP.


Then i am assigning the Host, Port, and Encryption method of the transaction.


Then i am calling to the setFrom() method. Here i am validating the email address format, and than i am setting the "setfrom" variable with value 
The Class IS :         PHPMailer
functionc Is :         setFrom
Method name Is :       PHPMailer::setFrom
From this function i am calling to the has8bitChars(), validateAddress() method.


Then from the mymail.php i am adding the recepents address by calling addAddress() function.
The Class IS :           PHPMailer
functionc Is :           addAddress
Method name Is :         PHPMailer::addAddress
from the addAddress() function i am calling to the addOrEnqueueAnAddress() function of PHPMailer{} class, in this function i am setting up all the replayto address here.
The Class IS :           PHPMailer
functionc Is :           addOrEnqueueAnAddress
Method name Is :         PHPMailer::addOrEnqueueAnAddress
From which i am calling to the has8bitChars() and addAnAddress() function.


After that i am calling to the isHTML() method from the mymail.php and passing a argument as <false> to it, if it is not Html type then i will set the content type to text.
The Class IS :           PHPMailer
functionc Is :           isHTML
Method name Is :         PHPMailer::isHTML


After this the real mail sending function comes into action, and i am calling to the send() method of {PHPMailer} object
$mail->send(); //sending the mail here, on the mail object{}
The Class IS :           PHPMailer
functionc Is :           send
Method name Is :         PHPMailer::send
    From here i am calling to the preSend() method of PHPMailer{} object.
    The preSend() prepares a message to send. Now the preSend() method is calling to the setLE() method of PHPMailer{} Object. here i am checking the value of mail.add_x_header
    The Class IS :           PHPMailer
    functionc Is :           setLE
    Method name Is :         PHPMailer::setLE
        Then again from the preSend() method i am calling to the punyencodeAddress()
        The File Is :            /opt/lampp/htdocs/mail/PHPMailer.php
        The Class IS :           PHPMailer
        functionc Is :           punyencodeAddress
        Method name Is :         PHPMailer::punyencodeAddress
            Now the punyencodeAddress() method is calling to the idnSupported() method of PHPMailer{} class.
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            functionc Is :           idnSupported
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::idnSupported
            In this method we are ensuring wheather methods like idn_to_ascii() & mb_convert_encoding() exists ..?
        After that with the following method call happens : has8bitChars(), validateAddress() function from the punyencodeAddress() function.
        After which the preSend() method's foreach loop get executed, and it calls to the punyencodeAddress() method which in turn calling to the idnSupported()
        Now the control returns back into the preSend() method where i am calling to the alternativeExists() method of PHPMailer{} class
        After which from the preSend() method i am calling to the setMessageType() method of PHPMailer{} class
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            functionc Is :           setMessageType
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::setMessageType
            Now the setMessageType() method is calling to the alternativeExists(), inlineImageExists(), attachmentExists()
                The Class IS :           PHPMailer
                Method name Is :         PHPMailer::alternativeExists
                The Class IS :           PHPMailer
                Method name Is :         PHPMailer::inlineImageExists
                The Class IS :           PHPMailer
                Method name Is :         PHPMailer::attachmentExists
        Then the function control comes back into the preSend() method, from which i am calling to the createBody() method.
        functionc Is :           createBody
        Method name Is :         PHPMailer::createBody
            Now the createBody() is calling to the generateId(), setWordWrap, method.
            functionc Is :           generateId
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::generateId
            functionc Is :           setWordWrap
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::setWordWrap
            Now the function call returns back into the createBody() method where we are calling to the has8bitChars() method and then setting the encoding format of message body to us-ascii.
            Than again from the createBody() method i am calling to the hasLineLongerThanMax() & has8bitChars() method of PHPMailer{} class.
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::hasLineLongerThanMax
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::has8bitChars
            After that the control comes back into the createBody() method & hasLineLongerThanMax() get called,
            & then switch..case.. get executed, the following method is get called.
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::getBoundary
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::textLine
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::encodeString
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::normalizeBreaks
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::normalizeBreaks

            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::normalizeBreaks
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::encodeString
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::getBoundary
            The Class IS :           PHPMailer
            Method name Is :         PHPMailer::textLine

    Then i am calling to the isValidHost() method of PHPMailer{} class
    The Class IS :           PHPMailer
    Method name Is :         PHPMailer::isValidHost
After that the function call returns back into the smtpConnect() method of PHPMailer class, now from the smtpConnect() method i am calling to the connect() method of SMTP{} class
Then again from the PHPMailer{} class i am calling to the connect() method of SMTP{} class
The Class IS :           SMTP
Method name Is :         SMTP::connect

    From inside the connect() method i am calling to the setError() method
    The Class IS :           SMTP

                The Class IS :           SMTP
                Method name Is :         SMTP::connected \\Now from the connected() method we are sending the EHLO through stream_get_meta_data() 
                    //$this->client_send($commandstring . static::LE, $command); \\'User & Password', 'Username', 'Password'
                    //here we are passing the command_string, and smtp line break \r\n, and the command EHLO
                    The Class IS :           SMTP
                    Method name Is :         SMTP::client_send
                    The Class IS :           SMTP
                    Method name Is :         SMTP::edebug







2019-02-16 07:34:10 CLIENT -> SERVER: EHLO localhost





[[[[[]]]]]
    I am sending email from localhost,localdomain to one of the smtp client[Mail Transfer Agent : Mailgun]
    From which i am again sending the mail to the destination.
